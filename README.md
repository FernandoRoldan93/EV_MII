## Computer Engineering Master 19-20

During this subject in the computer engineering master we work with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) trying to develop a virtual environment. This work was divided in various parts or practical works, in this repository can be found all this works wich are listed below.

#### Practical work 1
In this first part we just try blender doing a simple task of our choice. In my case, i did all the type of pieces in the chest game. The .blend file can be found here: [chess.blend](./Practice_1/chess.blend)

#### Practical work 2
In this part we started our virtual environment modeling some part of it. I decided to modelate the [Tesla Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/es_es/cybertruck). The blend file can be found here: [Car_model.blend](./Practice_2/Car_model.blend)

#### Practical work 3
For the first practice we added some textures and materials to our models. In this case I create the materials for the car. The blend file can be found here: [Textures.blend](./Practice_3/Textures.blend)

#### Practical work 4
Being this exercise the last one we created the scenario for our virtual environment. I created a scenario that simulates the drive of the car previously modeled in a full moon night. The scenario consists in a circuit including some obstacles. The blend file can be found here: [Scenario.blend](./Practice_4/Scenario.blend)
